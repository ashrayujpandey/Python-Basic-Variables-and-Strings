Basic Examples of Variables and Strings in Python.
This repository includes fundamental examples of how to use variables and strings in Python. Variables are used to store data, which can be of various types such as integers,
floats, and strings. For example, you can assign values to variables and perform operations like swapping their values using arithmetic. Strings, on the other hand, are 
sequences of characters. Basic string operations include reversing the string using slicing and removing spaces by replacing them with an empty string. These operations 
are essential for manipulating and working with text data in Python.
